# A YouTube Channel Evolution During Covid-19 Pandemic: From 100 to 4.5M subscribers!
### Data Mining · Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) · Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Problem:** How profitable is a YouTube channel?

**Solution:** I defined a Python function to extract the data of a channel from the
YouTube API, stored, processed and cleaned the data collected. After that, I estimated the
channel revenue and did an exploratory data analysis to get insights from the data.

**Result:** The analysis showed that the channel raised more than 1500% in two years reaching
a revenue from YouTube ads that could reach US$ 6 million.


## Abstract

During the Covid-19 pandemic and the social displacement adopted, some people increased their time watching educational and entertaining videos on YouTube, which caused a rapid growing of some channels during this period. In this project we will analyze how the YouTube chanell "Inventor 101" raised from near 100 subscribers to more than 4.5 million in 3 years. Inventor 101 is a DIY irish channel where the author publishes inventions and science experiments made by himself, every weeky. We will start extracting the data from the YouTube API and preprocessing/cleaning the data collected. After that, we will create data visualizations to get some insights and we will do a exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize their main characteristics. Finally, we will discuss the agregated value of our analysis to the Inventor 101 channel and other similar content.
