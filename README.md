Inventor 101 is a DIY irish channel where the author publishes inventions and science experiments made by himself, every weeky. We will start extracting the data from the YouTube API and preprocessing/cleaning the data collected. After that, we will create data visualizations to get some insights and we will do a exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize their main characteristics.
